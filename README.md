# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

##### A Database Management System Course Project containing all the features, SQL scripts, and options to serve as a DBMS for State Town Library üöÄ

### Introduction:
Our system is based on library management and book-keeping system. This project ‚ÄúLibrary Management System‚Äù contains data relevant to the books present in the library, which can be lent to the customers and details maintained by the staff. Along with the management of the system, we are also maintaining the records of issue statuses and publishers of the books.

### Mission Objective:
The objective of the project is to provide ease in feasibility to both staff and customers. According to this specific demand lending of books was done by making registration of the customer in a branch so that may track the data not only relevant to the customer but to the branch itself. Meanwhile, customers can generate an issuance status after borrowing a book to keep the track of it. In addition, the staff is enabled to maintain and update the status of all the books in the library.

### Scenario:
Considering a use case of a customer arriving at a library having a specific distinct branch ID. The available books in the library appear in the form of a view which restricts the customer to only look and check those books which are available on the current date. Books are managed by the Staff. Each staff has their own identity of authentication and sign-in. When a customer takes a book from the library a Status of Issuance is released by the staff in order to keep the track of the lending book. The Issue status gets updated from time to time depicting the current status of the book.
